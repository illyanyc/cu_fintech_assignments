## Abstract
Time Series Forecasting and Regression Analysis were performed on [Japanese Yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (Â¥) dataset. Time series forecasting utilized the [Hodrick-Prescott Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodrick%E2%80%93Prescott_filter) methods, [Agressive-moving-average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%E2%80%93moving-average_model) (ARMA), [Autoregressive integrated moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) (ARIMA) and [Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/garch.asp) (GARCH) methodologies.

## Time Series Forecasting
Time series analysis is a series of data points indexed in the time domain [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)]. In this assignment, 4 additional forecasting methods are used:<br>
* [Hodrick-Prescott Filter Decomposition]
* [ARMA Model Returns Forecasting]
* [ARIMA Model Settle Price Forecasting]
* [Forecasting Volatility with GARCH.]


## Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a collection of statistical methods for determine the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Regression breaks down into linear and  that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)]
