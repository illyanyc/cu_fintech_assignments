## Overview and Origin
### Overview
Wealthfront Inc. is an automated investment service firm based in Palo Alto, California, [[1]](#references "Wealthfront Corporation; D&B Business Directory; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021") founded by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008 [[2]](#references "Wealthfront Origin; www.wealthfront.com; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021"), and launched in 2011 [[3]](#references "Wealthfront Debuts Customized, Intelligent Online Investment Advisor For The Tech Community, TechCrunch.com; Accessed Mar. 25th, 2021"). Wealthfront utilizes AI and machine learning to provide [robo-advising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-advisor) services for a fraction of the cost of traditional advisors [[4]](#references "Fees for Investment Accounts; Wealthfront Support Page; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021").

### About the Founders
Andy Rachleff is a co-founder of VC firm [Benchmark Capital](http://www.benchmark.com/) and teaches technology entrepreneurship courses at Stanford Graduate School of Business [[5]](#references "Andrew S. Rachleff Faculty Profile; Stanford Graduate School of Business; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021"), while Dan Carroll is a former trader. The idea for the company came about when one of the founders Dan Carroll was helping his parents re-balance their portfolios after the 2008 crash. Then, he has realized that portfolio managers neglect small accounts in favor of larger ones, therefore the smaller accounts consistently underperform. This has lead him to develop a prototype of software that algorithmically allocates assets within the portfolio [[2]](#references "Wealthfront Origin; www.wealthfront.com; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021"). Shortly after, Dan was introduced to Andy, and together they have set off to:
> *"help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice"* [[2]](#references "Wealthfront Origin; www.wealthfront.com; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021")

### Funding
Wealthfront was initially funded in 2008 with an $3M angel round funded by Marc Andreessen, Jeff Jordan, and Ben Horowitz of [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/), as well as many others, including Andy Rachleff himself. Thereafter, Wealthfront has raised over \$200M more, in Series A through E funding rounds, with the latest one being in 2018 [[6]](#references "Wealthfront Company Financials; Crunchbase.com; Accessed Mar. 24, 2021").


## Business Activities
### Target Problem: Expensive investment advise
In 2008, Wealthfront's founders have identified a problem, where around 80% of all investors were neglected by their investment advisors and portfolio managers, resulting in their accounts underperforming compared to the other 20% of investors. The main distinction between the two groups of investors was their net worth. Traditionally, investment advisory firms charge 1-3% annually and have large overhead driven by fixed salaries and bonuses [[7]](#references "The Heavy Toll Of Investment Fees; Forbes.com; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021"). This in turn creates an environment where investment advisors provide more attention to the accounts of the wealthy as opposed to the average person.  In order to bring high quality portfolio allocation to the main-street investor, Wealthfront has set out to:

> *"optimize your money across spending, savings, and investments, putting it all to work effortlessly"* [[8]](#references "Wealthfront Homepage; Wealthfront.com; Accessed Mar. 25th 2021")

### Solution: Automation hrough Machine Learning
Wealthfront has decided to solve this problem with technology. Utilizing advances in online baking, data science, machine learning have paved the way for smart asset allocation, creating a new FinTech field of robo-investing. Robo-advising combines the fields of online banking, investment advising and portfolio management. [[9]](#references "What Are Robo-Advisors, and How Do They Differ?; Wealthfront Industry Insights; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021")

### Secondary Problem & Solution: Automation all the way
Additional problem identified by Wealthfront was financial discipline of their target demographic [[10]](#references "Wealthfront’s leader on investment fees, millennials, and the competition; Fortune.com; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021"), resulting in offering *Autopilot* services, which is part of Wealthfront's *Self-Driving Money™* vision, where each is paycheck automatically allocated to your savings, emergency, and investment accounts [[11]](#references "Meet Autopilot, a New Service that Automates Your Savings Strategy; Wealthfront Blog; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021"). *Self-Driving Money™* allows users to utilize the *set-it and forget it* approach to saving and investing, previously comparable to services of expensive money managers.


## Landscape:
### Robo-advising and *Self-Driving Money™*
<img src="images/autopilot_wealthfront.png" width="550" title="Image taken from Meet Autopilot, a New Service that Automates Your Savings Strategy: https://blog.wealthfront.com/meet-autopilot-a-new-service-that-automates-your-savings-strategy/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_twitter&utm_campaign=autopilot_launch911">
<!-- sorry had to use HTML above since Markdown image resizing didn't work on Jupyter -->

The main business driving Wealthfront's innovation is robo-advising. Robo-advising constitues of automatic portfolio allocation propelled by machine learning algorithms and theoretically provide the best possible portfolio allocation for that particular user, given the data. 

Generally, robo-advisors base your portfolio’s asset allocation on what’s known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) [[12]](#references "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Investopedia.com, Accessed Mar. 27, 2021"). MPT allocates portfolio based on the historical risk/reward ratio, where the risk is usually the volatility of the asset and the reward is the historical performance of the asset. Traditionally, a properly allocated portfolio usually has the assets lining the Efficient Frontier [[13]](#references "Efficient Frontier, Investopedia.com, Accessed Mar. 27, 2021") where the portfolio will have:

> "highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return" [[13]](#references "Efficient Frontier, Investopedia.com, Accessed Mar. 27, 2021")

Of course, the novel machine learning methods derived from the innovation in artificial intelligence over the past few years, provide for a more effective and efficient portfolio allocation. These methods are proprietary to Wealthfront.

Robo-advisors also offer additional options to the user, allowing them to construct their own portfolio, allowing users to invest money in specific sectors or to support specific causes, such as *socially responsible investing* [[9]](#references "What Are Robo-Advisors, and How Do They Differ?; Wealthfront Industry Insights; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021").

Wealthfront identifies their investment methodology as:

> 1. Identify a diverse set of asset classes
> 2. Select the most appropriate ETFs to represent each asset class
> 3. Apply Modern Portfolio Theory to construct asset allocations that maximize the expected net of-fee, after tax real return for each level of portfolio risk  
> 4. Determine your risk tolerance to select the allocation that is most appropriate for you
> 5. Monitor and periodically rebalance your portfolio taking advantage of dividend reinvestment

They continuously monitor and rebalance portfolios to ensure the optimal diversification and risk mitigation. Wealthfront also attempts to minimize taxes by analyzing the tax rates of assets in the underlying portfolios and rebalancing them accordingly, prioritizing low-tax rates, especially for retirement portfolios [[14]](#references "Wealthfront Investment Methodology White Paper; Wealthfront.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021").

### Core Innovation: AI and Machine Learning
The core innovation utilized by Wealthfront for automatic portfolio management, robo-advising, is machine learning (ML). Although machines learning can be considered a *black box* system, with hidden layers that are hard to interpret and analyze for humans, it is nevertheless proven to be effective. Wealthfront uses datasets of user data parameters to train ML models that analyze and back test portfolio performance on user groups and individualized levels. This in essence, theoretically, gives Wealthfront user portfolios an edge over traditionally manually managed portfolios [[15, 16]](#references "How AI is Shaping the Advisory Landscape; Investopedia.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021;          Machine learning for robo-advisors: testing for neurons specialization; Business Perspectives; Volume 16 2019; Issue #4; pp. 205-214; http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/imfi.16(4).2019.18").

### Competition
Although, the ex-CEO of Wealthfront, Adam Nash, previously said that:

> “We’re not very concerned about the large companies being able to keep pace... They simply can’t innovate and deliver features fast enough." [[17]](#references "Wealthfront Now Manages More that $2 Billion in Client Assets; TechCrunch.com; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021")

the competition has been fierce. Financial advising is large field with many big players. From traditional advisory firms such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab, to high tech online advisors such as Betterment and Personal Capital, competition is fierce.

<!-- sorry had to use HTML above since Markdown image resizing didn't work on Jupyter -->

Where [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) and [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) offer dedicated financial advisors for their premium offerings, Wealthfront has remained a pure robo-advisor. 

Currently Vanguard and Charles Schwab are the absolute leaders of robo-advising with $161B and $41B respectively [[18]](#references "Robo-advisors With the Most Assets Under Management -2020; RoboAdvisorPros.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021"). As for direct competitors in the field, Betterment is reported to have $22B AUM and 500,000 users [[19]](#references "Betterment surpasses $22 billion AUM in 500,000 user accounts, InvestmentNews.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021"), and Wealthfront closely lagging behind by $1B, with $21B AUM [[18]](#references "Robo-advisors With the Most Assets Under Management -2020; RoboAdvisorPros.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021"). Personal Capital is lagging far behind with only $14B AUM [[18]](#references "Robo-advisors With the Most Assets Under Management -2020; RoboAdvisorPros.com; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021").

### Demographic
Wealthfront target demographic is "millennials". It has been reported that over 60% of Wealthfront's demographic is under 30 years old [[10]](#references "Wealthfront’s leader on investment fees, millennials, and the competition; Fortune.com; Accessed Mar. 25, 2021").


## Results
The impact that Wealthfront has had on the FinTech industry has been immense. It has allowed regular investors to get professional investment advice and portfolio allocation without the neglect that traditional investment advisors have shown investors with relatively small net worth. This was accomplished via the use of novel machine learning methods and the low cost of modern-day server-side data processing.

Wealthfront compares favorably with its competitors, in particular, Betterment. Although Betterment offers free financial planning tools and portfolio goal flexibility, Wealthfront offers additional products [[20]](#references "Betterment vs. Wealthfront: Which is Best for You?; Investopedia.com; Accessed Mar. 27th, 2021") such as:

1. 529 College Savings
2. Wealthfront cash account
3. Portfolio lines of credit
4. PassivePlus invsting, which offers additional benefits to larger accounts (>$100,000) such as stock-level tax-loss harvesting and risk parity, and at largest accounts (>$500,000), the strategy includes Smart Beta [[20]](#references "Betterment vs. Wealthfront: Which is Best for You?; Investopedia.com; Accessed Mar. 27th, 2021"), which weights the stocks in your portfolio more intelligently.

All in all Wealthfront is positioned to surpass Betterment and remain competitive in the fields of robo-investing and automated money management. With the growth of their *Self-Driving Money™* product, it is also positioned to remain competitive in the online banking sector as well.


## Recommendations
If Wealthfront is to expand their operations and to offer a new service, I would suggest offering an opportunity for independent quantitative analyst and customers to assist in selecting securities by analyzing Wealthfront's data utilizing their own machine learning algorithms. Such a model is alread in use by a quantitative hedge fund Numerai [[21]](#references "Numerai Homepage; Numer.ai; Accessed Mar. 27, 2021"). Numerai offers their investors and independent contributors proprietary crypto-asset (coin) in return for processed data. Numerai provides the independent analysts with normalized data, and in return accepts back tested models. It then selects best back tested model and allocates their investors portfolios accordingly. The proprietary coin can be redeemed at the fund.

Wealthfront can utilize a similar model and offer their users, independent analysts, or professional money managers access to their data in return for a Wealthfront Coin that is redeemable as investment in Wealthfront's services or as a management fee credit. The amount of crypto-assets distributed in return for processed data could be directly proportional to the future return of the back tested model. The coins can be paid out as over a particular time as the performance of the model is evaluated. Less tech savvy users can get allocated Wealthfront Coins for simply sharing compute space on their local machines, which would run Wealthfront's algorithms in decentralized manner.

Such a service would not only directly benefit the users, it will draw more users and investors in Wealthfront's services via redemption of the Wealthfront Coins. It would also directly benefit Wealthfront by contributing new investment ideas to their already successful system.

This service would utilize current machine learning technologies such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to model raw financial data, back test and create financial models.
